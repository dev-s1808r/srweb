      <p>
        It’s fascinating that you’ve stumbled here. I’m Sourabh. I do many
        things, but they’re all tied together by a single thread: my passion to
        create and my curiosity to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive on deep conversations that stretch beyond casual exchanges into
        questions of meaning, progress, and possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is where I share the ideas, projects, and reflections that
        matter to me. If any of it resonates, I’d love for us to stay connected.
      </p>

        <h2>Chronicles of gratitude</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve been shaped not just by what I built, but by the
          people I walked alongside. 
          <p>
                 This section is my way of sharing small
          notes of gratitude for the people who have influenced me in a good
          way.
          </p>
     
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>On building things</h2>
        <p>
          Alongside my ventures, I have built several things. Some have worked,
          some failed. But every effort has taught me something about people,
          about systems, and about possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times they revealed how fragile ambition can be. At other times,
          they showed how resilient we are. And often, they reminded me that
          building is less about perfection and more about learning in motion.
        </p>
         <p>
          Here I have tried to gather a few things about all that I’ve been building: ventures, frameworks, communities. Most of them are journeys that are ongoing, a few of them are lessons learnt.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Expressions</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the content on this website is text-based, in the form of
          articles. I found my love for writing during my college days and it
          has only grown ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to writing, the world of audio-visual media eventually
          fascinated me. My dad bought me a DSLR during engineering. I even
          tried to make a documentary film! I am jack of a few instruments as
          well!
        </p>
        <p>
          Intertwined intrinsically with the previous section, this section is where I have maintained all my attempts to be myself in public!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Social media</h2>
        <p>
         I was born in the 90s in India, and I grew up pretty much alongside technology. I had access to the internet fairly early on. I remember creating my first email ID in 2006 and joining Orkut around the same time! I created my first blog in 2009-09 and I uploaded my first video on YouTube in 2010 (a Bollywood song I played on my guitar) and got on Facebook soon after... all while I was still in school!
        </p>
        <p>
          The point I am trying to make here is not how privileged or smart I was. Looking back, more than anything, I am grateful to my parents for making it all accessible to me without restrictions. The point I am trying to make is that, over the last decade, I’ve lived with social media long enough to know that, like many from my generation, it has shaped me in different ways. That influence has also made me more conscious about how I want to use it in my life today.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          In recent years, I’ve come to see social media as a great place to meet interesting people and have meaningful conversations. That’s exactly what my social media accounts are for. So, please feel free to reach out.

        <h2>Closing note</h2>
        <p>
          All said and done, I’m just the guy next door. Putting it all out like
          this makes me a little nervous and anxious. Mostly because I’ve often
          wrestled with a dilemma: whether the stories I carry are really worth
          sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet here I am, choosing to share them anyway. Not because I have the perfect answers, but because stories connect us. If even one thought here sparks a reflection or a conversation, then sharing them was worth it.
