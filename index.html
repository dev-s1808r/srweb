        <h1>But why?</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          I don't remember exactly when the thought of building a website popped
          up in my mind. It wasn't as if I didn't have a digital presence. In
          fact, I have been present on digital media for a long time. I remember
          opening my account on Orkut way back in 2005 or 2006 (I was in school
          then, and I 'mistakenly' entered my age as above 18!). Then I wrote my
          first blog on Blogger in 2007. I was still in school then. I uploaded
          my first YouTube video, probably in 2010 or may be 2011. I was playing
          a Hindi song on my guitar in the video. Then, of course, came
          Facebook. I had a couple of accounts on Facebook. I was, and I still
          am, on LinkedIn and Twitter as well. These days, I primarily use
          Instagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my digital presence on these sites has been limited to sharing
          photos, videos, or write-ups. It was by accident that I realized that
          I like clicking photos. My dad eventually bought me a camera, and my
          love for photography flourished, and my misadventures in video making
          also started. Writing, on the other hand, was actually a natural
          extension of my thought process. I used to pen my thoughts when I felt
          the clutter was too much to process. I didn't keep count of the photos
          I clicked because there were too many. Videos, on the other hand, were
          too few to count. But I did count my write-ups once, and the number
          was around 150 in total.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, considering all this, I can fairly conclude that a
          "nee-to-express" was never really the reason for me to build my
          website because I have been expressing anyway, and, in fact, in many
          ways. It wasn't a desire to create some digital monument either. That
          said, I vaguely remember thinking, "Hey! I should have one place where
          all the content that I have created is available in one repository,
          and I should be able to decide the flow, the narrative, the
          aesthetics, and whatnot."
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial reaction to this, which I remember only vaguely, was that
          of skepticism—mostly because it made me feel as if I were some control
          freak who was insecure about losing control over his narrative (by the
          way, I go by pronouns he/him)—and partly because the effort of
          building such a thing from scratch was overwhelming, and I just didn't
          know where to start or how to design it and the rest. So, I kept
          procrastinating on the thought of building my website until the switch
          somehow flipped, and I was suddenly filled with the motivation of
          "building my own digital abode," "a corner in the vast universe of
          zeros and ones," "a place where everyone could find me," "a testament
          to the brand Sourabh Raghavendra." I don't know when it happened; I
          don't remember what caused it (although, knowing myself, I could say I
          may have seen some stunning portfolio website that made me want to
          build something like that). I don't know.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, that journey, too, wasn't easy either. I went through
          several iterations of design, of content, of structure. I wrote a lot,
          and then erased it all! I started with the cursor blinking on a blank
          page until the screen turned off to save battery, and then,
          unwillingly, I began with my frustrated face too! Until very recently,
          I used to brush all this frustration under the rug of "writer's
          block," and it used to make me feel a little better in the (literal)
          face of frustration, but then at some point, I realized that if I had
          to move past this phase, I had to gather some courage to accept the
          fact that I was over-obsessed with perfection to the degree of
          intellectual paralysis. I was somehow not okay with something that was
          simple. I used to "feel" that complexity was the ultimate
          sophistication. Well, it may or may not be. I don't know. One thing,
          however, that I know is that it doesn't help you build your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all this in mind, one fine late night (February 24, 2025), I sat
          down with a question and a decision.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do I want to build a website?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Decision:</strong> The answer to this question will be the
          first page of my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, here it is: my website:
          <a href="https://sourabhraghavendra.in"
            >https://sourabhraghavendra.in</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>I will be posting more and more content for sure.</p>
        <p>
          If I forget, feel free to ping me at
          <a href="mailto:connect@sourabhraghavendra.in"
            >connect@sourabhraghavendra.in</a
          >
          to remind me that it has been <span id="daysElapsed"></span> days
          since I last updated my website.
